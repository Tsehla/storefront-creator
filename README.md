You're welcome! A few quick tips for when you implement the Android app:
Remember to test on different screen sizes
Make sure your server is accessible from the device/emulator
For testing locally use: http://10.0.2.2:3000 (for emulator) or your computer's local IP (for physical device)
Consider adding a splash screen while the WebView loads
Test both portrait and landscape orientations
